@page lib_crypto_backend_optiga OPTIGA(TM) backend

The OPTIGA backend for nrf_crypto provides selected features of the Infineon 
OPTIGA(TM) Trust X via the nrf_crypto API.
Infineon OPTIGA(TM) Trust X is a high-end security controller with a large set
of features to secure devices.
The select Trust X functions supported via the OPTIGA backend are:
- Random number generation
- ECDH to compute shared secrets
- ECDSA siganture computation and verification for EC curve secp256r1
- Conversion functions for keys to use them with Trust X

The backend is based on the OPTIGA(TM) Trust X Application Notes Framework
available with more documentation at: https://github.com/infineon/optiga-trust-x

@note All APIs in this backend are intended to be internal to nrf_crypto.

@section lib_crypto_backend_optiga_config Configuration

See @ref lib_crypto_config for details on enabling this backend.

@section lib_crypto_backend_optiga_home Available frontend API

See @ref lib_crypto for nrf_crypto APIs that can use this backend.

@subsection lib_crypto_backend_optiga_readme Important information

Due to EasyDMA restrications on nRF52832 devices, it is necessary to set a 
projet-level defince `DL_MAX_FRAME_SIZE=250` to use the nrf5x Platform 
Abstraction Layer (PAL). This PAL is required by the Trust X host library, which
 is used by the OPTIGA backedn implementation.

To use the PAL together with other I2C devices and be able to run it also on a 
BLE Shield2Go, define `IFX_2GO_SUPPORT` on project-level.

The OPTIGA library allocates memory on the heap. For proper operation, the heap
should be larger than 8,192 Bytes.
